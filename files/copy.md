> Shifting a team stuck in tool-mode to use of self.

### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Programme** | Transformation |
| **Industry** | FMCG / Consumer Goods |
| **Scope** | 30+ participants, 8 APAC markets, 2-month co-design |

---

### The Story

> The marketing team knew design thinking. They'd been trained. They had the tools. They could run a double diamond in their sleep. But something wasn't landing.
>
> The sessions felt mechanical. The outputs were competent but forgettable. The team was going through the motions—stuck in tool-mode, not using themselves.
>
> I was brought in to design a behaviour-shift programme. Not another training. Not another framework. Something that would actually change how they showed up.
>
> We spent two months in co-design: understanding the culture, the blockers, the moments where things fell flat. Then we built a 2-day immersive experience around four behaviours: Curiosity, Intuition, Bravery, and Momentum.
>
> The workshop wasn't a lecture. It was a clue hunt. Discovery-based challenges. Segments built around specific behaviours they needed to practice—not just understand. A guidebook they could take home. Films I wrote and performed. AI coaches to push deeper thinking through the follow-up.
>
> By the end, the shift was visible. Not just in what they said—in how they moved, how they listened, how they risked being wrong out loud.

## CASE STUDY: Synthesis Internal (/case-studies/synthesis-internal)

### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Programme** | Integration Series |
| **Industry** | Consulting / Strategy |
| **Scope** | 20-30 junior strategists, 4 sessions × 1.5 hours |

---

### The Story

> Synthesis's junior strategists were analytically brilliant. Sharp decks. Tight logic. Clear recommendations. But they weren't moving clients—they were convincing them. And there's a difference.
>
> The team needed to design for resonance, not just rigour. The kind of presence that makes clients lean in, not just nod.
>
> I designed a 4-part integration series built around my Message, Messenger, Stage, Trigger framework. Each session focused on a different dimension of how we show up:
>
> **Message:** What's survival information? What do people actually need to remember? Kill your darlings. Concise narratives.
>
> **Messenger:** How do you show up? What does this moment need from you? Awareness of presence.
>
> **Stage:** What conditions does the room need? How does the Synthesis DNA show up in how they design space—the office, events, even the website?
>
> **Trigger:** What makes a moment stick? Leaders shared their own relationship with extra-ness. How they signal meaning.
>
> The series wasn't about adding skills. It was about surfacing what was already there—and giving them permission to use it.

## ABOUT (/about)

### Page Hero

**Name:**
> Ziff

**Title:**
> Facilitator & Experience Designer

---

### Bio

> Ziff is a facilitator and experience designer based in Singapore.
>
> He spent six years in advertising at Ogilvy and Saatchi, which is a long time to spend thinking about why people remember some things and forget others. The answer, it turns out, is rarely the thing you'd put in a strategy document. It's the weird stuff. The extra. The detail someone almost cut because it seemed indulgent. The extra is what turns ads into culture.
>
> Then came What If! Innovation, Accenture Song, and GovTech Singapore—which sounds like a lot of jobs, but really it was the same job: trying to make rooms full of adults feel something other than the quiet dread of another workshop.
>
> He trained at Hyper Island. He practises improv theatre, which is just paying money to be embarrassed on purpose.
>
> He teaches Design Innovation at Singapore Institute of Technology. Futures, systems, and applying design thinking to life. Not just how to make better products—how to make better decisions about the things that actually matter.
>
> Now he designs workshops and team experiences. The kind where someone says something true out loud for the first time. The kind people mention weeks later, unprompted, like a song they can't get out of their head.

### The Through-Line

### Current Role

**Title:** Independent Facilitator & Experience Designer

**Description:**
> I design workshops and team experiences with a little extra soul.
>
> **Recent work:**
>
> **Synthesis × Global FMCG Client**
> Designed an immersive behaviour-shift programme for an APAC marketing team at a global food packaging company. Clue hunt. Discovery-based challenges. Workshop segments built around specific behaviours. A guidebook. Films I wrote and performed. AI coaches to push deeper, more critical thinking through the process. The team knew design thinking but were going through the motions. The programme shifted them from tool-mode to use of self.
>
> **Synthesis (internal)**
> Designed and delivered a 4-part integration series for Synthesis's junior strategists. Analytically brilliant, but struggling to move clients, not just convince them. The programme helped them design for resonance, not just rigour. The kind of presence that makes clients lean in, not just nod.
>
> Both programmes worked with existing processes, not against them. That's the approach: mirror what's familiar, shift how people experience it.
>
> Open to team workshops, transformation programmes, and the interesting stuff.

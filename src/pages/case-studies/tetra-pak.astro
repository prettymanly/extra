  story: [
    "The marketing team knew design thinking. They had been trained. They had the tools. They could run a double diamond in their sleep. But something was not landing.",
    "The sessions felt mechanical. The outputs were competent but forgettable. The team was going through the motions—stuck in tool-mode, not using themselves.",
    "I was brought in to design a behaviour-shift programme. Not another training. Not another framework. Something that would actually change how they showed up.",
    "We spent two months in co-design: understanding the culture, the blockers, the moments where things fell flat. Then we built a 2-day immersive experience around four behaviours: Curiosity, Intuition, Bravery, and Momentum.",
    "The workshop was not a lecture. It was a clue hunt. Discovery-based challenges. Segments built around specific behaviours they needed to practice—not just understand. A guidebook they could take home. Films I wrote and performed. AI coaches to push deeper thinking through the follow-up.",
    "By the end, the shift was visible. Not just in what they said—in how they moved, how they listened, how they risked being wrong out loud."

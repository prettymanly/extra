  industry: "FMCG / Consumer Goods",
  scope: "20+ participants, 8 APAC markets, 2-month co-design",
  story: [
    "Twenty marketing managers walk into a room in Bangkok. They've done design thinking before. They know the Four I's. They can run a double diamond without thinking. They're expecting an advanced Design Thinking workshop. Instead, they get a dossier.",
    "The dossier wasn't a prop. It set the environment for the next two days. Before anyone touched a framework, the room reflected them back to themselves. This wasn't more Design Thinking. It was the work underneath it: pressure, ambiguity, identity, and the moment a client asks, \"So what do we do now?\" We call that Design Being.",
    "In discovery sessions with marketing managers across APAC, a pattern kept repeating. Workshops generate activity, then the client asks for direction and time collapses. The sharpest tension was identity. They were being asked to advise on business strategy while still being treated like packaging vendors. One person called it \"freaking out.\" She knew cardboard. Now she was being asked to fix a business model. In those moments, the tools become a hiding place, not because they're wrong, but because they're safe.",
    "So we built something different. Over two months of co-design, we anchored the Four I's to four behaviours that matter when the script collapses: Curiosity, Bravery, Intuition, Momentum. Then we stressed them on purpose. Midway through an exercise, the rule changed: \"Your customer just called. You have twenty minutes. What survives?\"",
    "You could feel the shift. Less performing. More choosing. Better questions. Teams left with a shared way to diagnose the real problem, handle pushback, and turn ambiguity into the next credible move. One participant later wrote that she'd been too eager to solve symptoms, and would spend more time working with clients on the real issue underneath. Another called it \"unprofessional in the best way.\" On the way out, someone left a note near the door: \"Certainty is expensive. Momentum is cheap.\"",
    "The artefacts weren't decoration. They were the mechanism."

        "Most workshops start with a problem statement and a polite agreement to pretend the brief is the truth.",
        "We didn't.",
        "We started by designing a world that could hold the mess. The Apex Beverages dossier was not a \"case\" to discuss. It was an environment to navigate. It had the texture of real client work: partial information, conflicting signals, stakeholder emotion hiding in plain sight. The point was to make ambiguity unavoidable, because that's where the real behaviours show up.",
        "Then we made it personal, fast. The quiz-lanyards arrived before the frameworks. Each one reflected a behaviour participants had already identified in themselves. It shifted the room from performance to practice. Suddenly the breaks weren't downtime. They were rehearsal.",
        "The world did one job: it made it safe to be exposed and impossible to hide."

      narrative: [
        "In most rooms, tools are used to look busy. In tense rooms, they become camouflage.",
        "So we designed tools that do the opposite. Each tool was nested under a behaviour, and each behaviour was treated like a stance you could inhabit, not a value you could agree with. The Field Guide became the spine: four behaviours, the tools underneath them, and space to reflect on what happened, not just what was produced.",
        "The Reverse Brief was the first pressure valve. Clients describe symptoms. Teams rush to solve them. The Reverse Brief forces a pause long enough to separate what was requested from what is needed.",
        "The Assumptionator made the invisible visible. Instead of debating opinions, it surfaced the beliefs nobody was testing, so the group could trade friction for learning.",
        "The Action Planner kept the work moving when certainty wasn't available. Exploit. Explore. Experiment. Not a grand strategy deck, but a way to choose the next credible move with the time you actually have.",
        "The tools weren't the workshop. They were the moves you reach for when the room gets real."

        "Priming content did the first bit of work. It set stakes and tone early, so day one didn't start with surface-level alignment. People arrived already inside the question, not outside it.",
        "If Curiosity is a stance, how does it sound? If Bravery is a move, what does it cost? The training films answered those questions. Not entertainment. Not inspiration. Just short scenes that made the behaviours observable, so teams could point to what good actually looks like. Written and performed, so the behaviours become repeatable, not abstract.",
        "And after the room emptied, the AI Coach carried the thread forward. It functioned as a thought partner that helped participants apply the behaviours to live accounts, when the pressure returned and the old habits came knocking.",

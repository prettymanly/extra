    "Twenty-something junior strategists sit in a Thursday team sharing at Synthesis. They're smart. Genuinely. The kind of people who can dismantle a brief in thirty minutes and rebuild it into something more interesting. But in the room with clients \u2014 something isn't happening. They're convincing people. They're not moving them. There's a difference. Nobody hired me to run YASvember. There was no brief, no budget line. Just a Thursday afternoon slot and an open question: what do junior strategists actually need?",
    "Nobody hired me to run YASvember. There was no brief, no budget line, no client. Just a Thursday afternoon team sharing slot at Synthesis \u2014 a small but mighty strategy consultancy \u2014 and an open question: what do junior strategists actually need to become better at their jobs? The official answer was usually: better frameworks. Sharper decks. More rigorous research. I thought the answer was something else entirely.",
    "Junior strategists at Synthesis were smart. Genuinely. The kind of people who could dismantle a brief in thirty minutes and rebuild it into something more interesting. But in the room with clients \u2014 something was happening. Or rather, not happening. They were convincing people. They weren't moving them.",
    "There's a difference. Convincing is an intellectual transaction: here is my argument, here is my evidence, here is my conclusion. Moving is something else. It's when someone leaves the room and can't stop thinking about what you said. When they forward your deck unsolicited. When they bring it up in a meeting you weren't in.",
    "The gap wasn't in the work. It was in the delivery. And not just delivery as in \"presentation skills\" \u2014 that's the wrong frame. It was something deeper: the gap between what they knew and who they were being when they said it.",
    "I took over the Thursday team sharings for November. Four sessions, 90 minutes each, twenty-something junior strategists. I called it YASvember. Partly because it was November. Mostly because it needed a name that didn't sound like training. Each session tackled one layer of the same question: what does it actually take to land an idea with another human being?",
    "We ended with a literal campfire ritual. Everyone wrote something they were leaving behind \u2014 a habit, a fear, a way of showing up that wasn't serving them. We burned them. Overdramatic? Maybe. Forgettable? Not a chance."

The question wasn't \"which one are you?\" It was \"which one does this moment call for, and can you choose it?\"",

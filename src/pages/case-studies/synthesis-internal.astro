    "Twenty-something junior strategists sit in a Thursday team sharing at Synthesis. They\u2019re smart. Genuinely. The kind of people who can dismantle a brief in thirty minutes and rebuild it into something more interesting. But in the room with clients \u2014 something isn\u2019t happening. They\u2019re convincing people. They\u2019re not moving them. There\u2019s a difference. Nobody hired me to run YASvember. There was no brief, no budget line. Just a Thursday afternoon slot and an open question: what do junior strategists actually need?",
    "Nobody hired me to run YASvember. There was no brief, no budget line, no client. Just a Thursday afternoon team sharing slot at Synthesis \u2014 a small but mighty strategy consultancy \u2014 and an open question: what do junior strategists actually need to become better at their jobs? The official answer was usually: better frameworks. Sharper decks. More rigorous research. I thought the answer was something else entirely.",
    "Junior strategists at Synthesis were smart. Genuinely. The kind of people who could dismantle a brief in thirty minutes and rebuild it into something more interesting. But in the room with clients \u2014 something was happening. Or rather, not happening. They were convincing people. They weren\u2019t moving them.",
    "There\u2019s a difference. Convincing is an intellectual transaction: here is my argument, here is my evidence, here is my conclusion. Moving is something else. It\u2019s when someone leaves the room and can\u2019t stop thinking about what you said. When they forward your deck unsolicited. When they bring it up in a meeting you weren\u2019t in.",
    "The gap wasn\u2019t in the work. It was in the delivery. And not just delivery as in \"presentation skills\" \u2014 that\u2019s the wrong frame. It was something deeper: the gap between what they knew and who they were being when they said it.",
    "I took over the Thursday team sharings for November. Four sessions, 90 minutes each, twenty-something junior strategists. I called it YASvember. Partly because it was November. Mostly because it needed a name that didn\u2019t sound like training. Each session tackled one layer of the same question: what does it actually take to land an idea with another human being?",
    "We ended with a literal campfire ritual. Everyone wrote something they were leaving behind \u2014 a habit, a fear, a way of showing up that wasn\u2019t serving them. We burned them. Overdramatic? Maybe. Forgettable? Not a chance."

  sessionsSubheadline: "Each session started with one premise. Everything else was designed to make it undeniable.",
  sessions: [
    {
      number: "01",
      name: "Message",
      premise: "Before you can deliver anything, you need to know what it\u2019s actually about.",
      body: "We opened with a provocation: most presentations have slides. Few have a spine. The session was built around the idea of the [Armature](/writing/the-armature) \u2014 the one undeniable thing a whole argument hangs on, borrowed from screenwriting. If you can\u2019t state it in a sentence, you don\u2019t own it yet.\n\nWe stress-tested this through [Baby-fying](/writing/baby-fying) \u2014 stripping a strategic recommendation down until a five-year-old could follow it. Not to dumb it down. To find out where the thinking actually breaks. Then [Killing Your Darlings](/writing/killing-your-darlings): the discipline of cutting what you love most when it doesn\u2019t serve the spine. Strategists hoard their best insights. The exercise was learning which ones to leave on the floor."
    },
    {
      number: "02",
      name: "Messenger",
      premise: "The same idea lands differently depending on who\u2019s delivering it \u2014 and who they\u2019re choosing to be.",
      body: "Session two was about identity under professional pressure. Most junior strategists had been trained to perform competence. This session asked a different question: which energy does this moment actually call for?\n\nWe worked through four archetypes \u2014 [Lover, King, Warrior, Jester](/writing/the-four-archetypes) \u2014 not as personality types but as modes you can consciously select. The exercise wasn\u2019t self-discovery. It was fluency. Then [No-Look Portrait](/writing/no-look-portrait): pairs draw each other without looking at the page. The result is always a mess. The point is that awkward and committed beats polished and absent \u2014 a truth that transfers directly to the boardroom. We closed with [Silent Shoe Sort](/writing/silent-shoe-sort), where the whole group organises their shoes without speaking. What surfaces is a live negotiation of logic, aesthetics, and power. You learn more about how someone leads in ten minutes of shoe sorting than in an hour of case studies."
    },
    {
      number: "03",
      name: "Stage",
      premise: "You are always designing an experience. The only question is whether you\u2019re doing it on purpose.",
      body: "The third session moved from self to room. Not the deck \u2014 the actual physical, emotional, social space where ideas either land or don\u2019t. Room setup signals power before a word is spoken. An energiser isn\u2019t a warm-up; it\u2019s a neurological reset that changes what\u2019s possible in the next hour.\n\nWe ran [Oil and Water](/writing/oil-and-water) \u2014 two groups, opposing positions, forced to find the productive tension neither could see alone. Then [Greenhousing](/writing/greenhousing): the discipline of keeping ideas warm before they\u2019re evaluated, because the instinct to critique kills fragile thinking before it becomes useful. The session ended with [Signalling](/writing/signalling) \u2014 a framework for reading the room in real time and adjusting accordingly, not after the fact."
    },
    {
      number: "04",
      name: "Trigger",
      premise: "The meeting ends. What stays?",
      body: "The final session was about the gap between a good idea and a remembered one. We introduced the [High Touch Axis](/writing/high-touch-axis) \u2014 four ways experiences become sticky: Ritual, Flow, Artefact, World. Most strategists invest everything in content. Almost none design for what lingers.\n\nWe ended YASvember the way the session demanded: with a campfire. Everyone wrote something they were leaving behind \u2014 a habit, a fear, a way of showing up that wasn\u2019t serving them anymore. We burned them. Leaders didn\u2019t observe. They participated. They talked about the parts of themselves they\u2019d learned to dial down in professional settings. [The Extra Seat](/writing/the-extra-seat) \u2014 leaving room in every experience for the unexpected human moment \u2014 became the last concept of the series because it was already happening in the room."

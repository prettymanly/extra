    "Synthesis's junior strategists were analytically brilliant. Sharp decks. Tight logic. Clear recommendations. But they weren't moving clients—they were convincing them. And there's a difference.",

    "I designed a 4-part integration series built around my Message, Messenger, Stage, Trigger framework. Each session focused on a different dimension of how we show up.",

        You remember Salt Bae for the salt-swan thing, not the steak. I've rewatched that Barry episode where a 12-year-old girl goes full feral mongoose, scales a tree, perches on a roof like a gargoyle, and bites a man's face. Season 2, Episode 5. 7 times. It had nothing to do with the plot. You probably had a teacher growing up who went too far to make a point.

        Meanwhile we've all sat through dozens of workshops and probably struggle to name a single moment that stuck.

        I think about that gap a lot. Salt Bae's extra-ness cost nothing. The workshop had a budget.

        So why do we walk into the office and accept forgettable?

        Be extra.

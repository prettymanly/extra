          Ziff is a facilitator and experience designer based in Singapore.
        </p>

        <p class="stagger-item text-warm-gray">
          He spent six years in advertising at Ogilvy and Saatchi, which is a long time to spend thinking about why people remember some things and forget others. The answer, it turns out, is rarely the thing you'd put in a strategy document. It's the weird stuff. The extra. The detail someone almost cut because it seemed indulgent.
        </p>

        <p class="stagger-item text-warm-gray">
          Then came What If! Innovation, Accenture Song, and GovTech Singapore—which sounds like a lot of jobs, but really it was the same job: trying to make rooms full of adults feel something other than the quiet dread of another workshop.
        </p>

        <p class="stagger-item text-warm-gray">
          He trained at Hyper Island. He practises improv theatre, which is just paying money to be embarrassed on purpose.
        </p>

        <p class="stagger-item text-warm-gray">
          He teaches Design Innovation at Singapore Institute of Technology. Futures, systems, and applying design thinking to life. Not just how to make better products—how to make better decisions about the things that actually matter.
        </p>

        <p class="stagger-item text-warm-gray">
          Now he designs workshops and team experiences. The kind where someone says something true out loud for the first time. The kind people mention weeks later, unprompted, like a song they can't get out of their head.
